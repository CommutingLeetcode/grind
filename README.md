# Leetcode meets commute

## General Idea:
We wanted to practice our tech interviewing skills by doing leetcode questions. Most people suggest doing 1 or 2 leetcode questions a day as the most effective way of learning. But often times we end up with days of laziness and feeling unmotivated, or even straight up forgetting to do the problems. We came up with the idea of making a framework, an easy and satisfying one (we’re using tools from atomic habits) to form a habit of doing leetcode everyday. We’ll make the process so easy and hassle-free that even on the most gruesome days where we don’t feel motivated to open leetcode, we’ll still be able to get at least one problem done for the day. The main idea is to utilize vancouver’s dreadful commute time to do/start the day’s leetcode problem (chosen by yourself). Instead of scrolling mindlessly through TikTok and wasting our precious time during commute, we can practice our interviewing skills. Our approach to studying leetcode is this: watch the video solution first, and then try to attempt it alone without any help.


## Atomic habits reference:


### Make it obvious (make the cues of good habits obvious and visible)
- Commuting is something really common and we do it everyday (make this a cue for doing leetcode)
- Notifications from other members
We have a groupchat and we’ll notify others once we have committed our code. We’ll use this as another cue

### Make it attractive
- Try to remember why you’re doing this, either you’re trying to find a better job, or you’re trying to break into your first job, or you’re aiming for FAANG. Remember why it’s attractive and why you want it so badly
- One way to do this is maybe to go to your dream company’s website or linkedin

### Make it easy
- Have the leetcode website bookmarked in your phone’s browser to reduce friction 
- Always have neetcode solution videos downloaded for easy access. Now that you have it in your phone, you can convince yourself to watch at least the first 2 minutes of the video solution to avoid friction of starting.

### Make it satisfying
- Once we’ve written the solution, we’ll push it to github under the same repo (which gives some sort of satisfaction especially when the green thing pops up on github)
We can track our commits with github and see who is lacking and missing streaks and who has not missed a day.
- On the flip side, IF we do not do one problem a day, we owe 15 dollars divided equally between the other members who are participating. (make it unsatisfying)
Rules:

## Rules:

1. ONE leetcode problem in a day (you can do more than one which doens’t affect the rules)
2. Push your solution file (code) to github, including a short explanation as a multiline comment at the bottom of the file: 
data structure(s) used
3. One thing that’s unique about this problem and what you learnt from it
4. Failure to complete the steps above will result in owing money to other members, a total of 15 dollars divided equally to other members who are participating

## FAQ:
- Why not do the same problem so that we can discuss it together?
- A problem might require the solver to understand several prerequisites (e.g. data structure used or continuation of a previous problem). I think it’s better to choose our own problems because every developer has their own timelines in their learning process.
